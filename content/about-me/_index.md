Hi! I'm Akhil, a current freshman in General Engineering at A&M! I'm into programming and robotics and I'm looking to go into computer science after my freshman year. 

Programming wise, I mainly code in Dart for mobile apps, but I've been learning new technologies for other projects such as C# for a Unity-based 3D game.

Outside of coding, I love spending my time at the rec center, whether I'm working out or playing a sport like volleyball or badminton with friends.
